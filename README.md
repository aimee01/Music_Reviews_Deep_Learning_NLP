# Music Reviews Rating / Sentiment Analysis
 
### Objectives ###
Using a dataset of gathering music reviews from a famous music online media, I created a deep learning model using LSTM layers to predict the score of each of these reviews.

### Dataset ###
I am using [18,393 Pitchfork Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/nolanbconaway/pitchfork-data) dataset from Kaggle. It presents more than 18,000 music reviews extracted from the music platform Pitchfork between 1999 and 2017.

### Results ###
The model has good results and predict well the score of the review. This model could be a useful tool to get an idea of the success of an album at a glance.
